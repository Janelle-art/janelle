        <h1>Short Introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Janelle Orko-Obrempong Abena Sakyibea.I'm 18 years old and the first born amongst my siblings.
            My favorite thing to do in my leisure hours is to learn new languages .I'm currently a biomedical engineering studen at
             The Kwame Nkrumah Uiversity of Science and Technology(KNUST)        </p>
             <h2>Why Biomedical Engineering</h2>
             I chose to study biomedical engineering because I wanted to have a fair idea of human anatomy and to what extent
             man-made devices affect the functioning of the body .I also want to be able to invent devices to help improve healthcare
             delivery.
